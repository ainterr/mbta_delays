# Personal MBTA Delay Tracker
I spend a lot of time commuting every day on the MBTA. Because of its aging,
horribly maintained infrastructure, the MBTA wastes a lot of my time due to
unforeseen delays (signal problems, buses breaking down, etc). The point of
this project (developed primarily while riding the T) is to quantify exactly
how much of my time the T wastes on a daily basis.

After I've collected some data, I'll write a
[blog](http://ainterr.github.io/blog) post about how exactly the back-end data
collection works.
