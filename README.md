# Personal MBTA Delay Tracker
I spend a lot of time commuting every day on the MBTA. Because of its aging,
horribly maintained infrastructure, the MBTA wastes a lot of my time due to
unforeseen delays (signal problems, buses breaking down, etc). The point of
this project (developed primarily while riding the T) is to quantify exactly
how much of my time the T wastes on a daily basis.

I wrote a [blog
post](http://ainterr.github.io/blog/technical/quantifying_mbta_delays.html)
describing the details of the back end of this project if you're interested.
